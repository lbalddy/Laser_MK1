Project goals:
1. maximize cutting area to footprint ratio
2. scalable design if desired
3. support multiple laser tube sizes currently 40w to 100w (with frame extension)
4. construction with off the shelf parts and minimal tooling
5. complex parts are 3d printed.


current design: 

3 MGN12 linear rails for X and Y motion. 

Z motion is achieved with a hand wheel and 4 AMCE lead screws. (power z modification is easily done)

Z travel is about 100mm (this can be easily extended as well)

frame and gantry are made from 2020 and 2040 t-slot extrusions.

cutting area dimensions are 820mm x 550mm with a full width passthrough slot in the Y direction


the .zip file contains the current .stp of the full assembly.
